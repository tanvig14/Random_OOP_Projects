# Problem Statement
Create an application using JAVA with 1 class for a TV and 1 interface for a mobile phone. Add a few methods performing some action in each. Provide a menu for the user to choose which action to take.

This program does not perform any action, it is simply meant to display the differences in inheritance from a class and an interface.
